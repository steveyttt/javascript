//ensure every piece of code only runs when it needs to

//functional expressions (Var functions) are never hoisted, they are treated as assignements
//functional expressions are expressions stored as var's
//Declared functions (traditional functions) are hoisted straight to the top


//keep functional expressions and var's above the code so they get assigned befoer running
//Use declared functions (traditional functions), these will be examined and stored in memory
